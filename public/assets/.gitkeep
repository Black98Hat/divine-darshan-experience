The following files are needed for the app to function:
- tirupati-entrance-blur.jpg (temple entrance blurred)
- temple-interior.jpg (temple interior)
- balaji-murti.png (Lord Venkateswara murti with transparency)
- diya.png (a flickering diya/oil lamp image with transparency)
- aarti-flame.png (a flame image with transparency)

Audio files needed:
- ambient-temple-entrance.mp3 (temple entrance sounds, bells in distance)
- temple-ambience.mp3 (main temple ambient sounds)
- temple-bell.mp3 (single bell ring sound)
- flower-offering.mp3 (subtle sound for flower offering)
- govinda-chant.mp3 (soft "Govinda Govinda" chant)

These files should be placed in this folder for the app to function properly.
Users will need to upload these files to the project or replace with appropriate alternatives.
